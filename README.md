# Stuck-Splash-Screen-Fixer-for-P3Dv4.3

INFO
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* Fixes the Splash Screen Freeze when opening P3D. Might work on other versions but only confirmed on v4.3.
* Its just a few minitues effort so Nothing fancy here; it just backs-up your sceanery.cfg file and deletes it. (I just saved you the effort of renaming/deleting the file form the program data/Lockheed/Prepar3d directory)

REQUIREMENTS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* This program requires you to have java installed so that you can run the JAR. I will upload an exe build soon.
* If the directory "program data/Lockheed/Prepar3d directory" is not in C:\, this wont work. Let me know if you are one of the few who has the OS loaded in D:\, E:\,...you get it, Let me know (email me) and I will cook something up for you
* Windows 7/8/10 only

RUNNING THE FIX
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* Unless you want to contribute your coding skills, you only need the "P3DFixer.JAR" file.
* Run as Administrator (Feel free to scan it for what ever)
* The next step is self-explanatory

FUTURE
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* Its bleak but I will add a 'fix every P3D related problems' magic button on it.
* In seriousness though, I will try to incorporate more bug fixes. Let me know if you stumble on annoying bugs lockheed is ignoring and I will take a look.
